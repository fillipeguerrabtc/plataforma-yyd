# YYD Platform - Yes You Deserve

## Overview
The YYD Platform is a complete premium electric tuk-tuk tour booking system for "Yes You Deserve," operating in Sintra/Cascais, Portugal.

The platform aims to be a comprehensive business management tool.

## User Preferences
- No mock data: Everything must be real
- No MVP: Build COMPLETE platform, not incremental
- Direct communication: User provides specific instructions
- Token economy: User brings specifications, agent executes
- Professional execution: Read everything completely, absorb knowledge, no superficial work

## System Architecture

### Authentication & Permissions (Updated Oct 22, 2025)
- **Individual Login**: Each user logs in with their own credentials and sees their own name in sidebar
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 5 roles with specific permissions
  - **Admin**: Full access to everything
  - **Director**: Full access except some admin settings (Danyella has this role)
  - **Finance**: Full financial access, read-only for operations
  - **Guide**: Limited to their own data (tours, bookings, customers)
  - **Support**: Customer service and bookings only
- **Resource Permissions**: 
  - `users` - Manage staff, guides, vendors (Admin + Director only)
  - `guides` - Manage guides and Stripe accounts
  - `finance` - Financial operations
  - `products`, `bookings`, `customers`, `reviews`, etc.
- **Staff-User Sync**: Creating/updating/deleting Staff automatically syncs with User table for login

### Stripe Connect - Universal Payment System (Oct 22, 2025)
- **Generic Payment Infrastructure**: Supports ALL people/partners, not just guides
- **Supported Entities**:
  - **Guides**: Tour guides with Stripe Express accounts
  - **Staff**: Employees receiving salary payments
  - **Vendors**: Suppliers and contractors
- **Database Schema**: 
  - All entities have: `stripeConnectedAccountId`, `stripeAccountStatus`, `stripeAccountType`, `stripeOnboardingCompleted`
  - Payroll model uses: `staffId`, `guideId`, `vendorId` with proper relations
- **Features**:
  - Create Stripe Express accounts
  - Generate onboarding links
  - View balances and account status
  - Process transfers and payouts
  - Track all transactions

### Technical Implementations
- **Backoffice (ERP+CRM)**: Comprehensive management of products (tours), staff/guides, finance (cash flow, payroll, Stripe integration, AR/AP, reporting), CRM (customer database, timeline, segmentation, automations, communication), and integrations. All features include CRUD operations, RBAC, and audit logging.
- **Aurora IA**: An AI-driven chat system for sales and customer service across web, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. It includes configurable behavior, a manageable knowledge base, and automated booking/payment processing.
- **Client Platform**: A clone of the existing website with full tour descriptions, correct seasonal/per-person pricing, a complete booking flow (including optional extras, payment processing via Stripe, and voucher generation), and a passwordless client area for managing bookings.

### System Design Choices
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure access, synced Staff/User tables
- **Data Handling**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM and pgvector for vector embeddings
- **Job Queues**: Bull for handling asynchronous tasks like emails
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with RBAC permission checks
- **Next.js Config**: Server Actions configured for Replit environment with allowed origins

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Payments**: Stripe (with Stripe Connect for payouts)
- **Messaging**: Twilio (for WhatsApp), Facebook Messenger API
- **AI**: OpenAI (optional fallback for Aurora IA)
- **Email**: Replit Mail (automatic authentication, works in dev & production)
- **Job Queues**: Bull

## Recent Implementations (Oct 2025)

  - All operations use Prisma transactions for atomicity
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: Fetches current user from `/api/auth/me` - shows actual logged-in user
- **Login Validation**: Checks `User.active` flag to block deactivated accounts
