# Payment & Confirmation Flow Documentation

## Overview
Complete end-to-end flow for booking payment and confirmation in the YYD platform.

---

## 🎯 **User Flow (Production)**

### 1. Customer Makes Booking
```
User → Selects Tour → Fills Form → Clicks "Pay Now"
```

### 2. Payment Processing
```
Frontend → Creates Stripe Payment Intent → Redirect to Stripe Checkout
```

### 3. After Payment
```
Stripe → Sends Webhook → Confirms Booking → Sends Email → Updates Calendar
```

### 4. Confirmation Page
```
Customer → Redirected to /booking-confirmation?bookingId=XXX
```

**The page automatically:**
- ✅ Polls every 3 seconds checking booking status
- ✅ When status changes from "pending" to "confirmed" → Shows success screen
- ✅ If payment fails → Shows failure screen
- ✅ Displays booking details, price, date, customer info

---

## ⚙️ **Development Workflow**

### Problem: Webhooks Don't Work in Dev
Stripe webhooks require a **public URL**, which localhost doesn't have.

### Solution: Manual Webhook Simulation

**Step 1: Customer Makes Booking**
- Customer fills form and clicks "Pay" in dev mode
- Booking is created with status: `pending`
- Payment Intent is created
- Customer is redirected to: `/booking-confirmation?bookingId=XXX`

**Step 2: Manually Confirm the Booking**
```bash
cd yyd/apps/client

# Find the booking ID from the URL or database
npx tsx scripts/test-webhook.ts <bookingId> <paymentIntentId>
```

**What the script does:**
1. ✅ Checks if booking is already confirmed (prevents double-booking)
2. ✅ Updates booking status to `confirmed`
3. ✅ Creates/updates payment record with `status: succeeded`
4. ✅ Creates calendar slot (idempotent - safe to rerun)
5. ✅ Updates customer stats (total bookings, total spent)
6. ✅ Sends confirmation email to customer

**Step 3: Customer Sees Confirmation**
- Page auto-refreshes every 3 seconds
- When status changes to `confirmed`, shows success screen
- Customer sees full booking details and next steps

## 📧 **Email Confirmation**

### Development & Production
**Replit Mail works in BOTH development and production!**

The system uses automatic authentication via environment tokens:
- **Development**: Uses `REPL_IDENTITY` token (automatic)
- **Production**: Uses `WEB_REPL_RENEWAL` token (automatic)

**No configuration needed** - Replit handles authentication automatically!

**Important**: Test emails like `test@example.com` will be rejected. Use real email addresses only.

---

## 🔐 **Security: Booking Access Control**

The `/api/bookings?id=XXX` endpoint has smart authorization:

### Rules:
1. **Authenticated users**: Can access their own bookings anytime
2. **Unauthenticated users**: Can access bookings created/updated in last **30 minutes**
   - This covers the payment → confirmation flow
   - Prevents unauthorized access to old bookings

### Why 30 minutes?
- Customer makes booking → Redirected to confirmation page
- Payment processing can take a few seconds
- Webhook confirms booking (updates `updatedAt`)
- Customer has 30 min window to view confirmation without logging in

---

## 🎬 **Auto-Refresh Logic**

The confirmation page (`/booking-confirmation/page.tsx`) uses smart polling:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch booking every 3 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(fetchBooking, 3000);
  
  // Stop polling when status is final
  if (status === 'confirmed' || status === 'payment_failed') {
    clearInterval(interval);
  }
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [bookingId]);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No manual refresh needed
- ✅ Stops automatically when confirmed
- ✅ Works for both success and failure cases
- ✅ Efficient (only polls while pending)

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Booking stuck in "Payment Processing"?
**Cause**: Webhook didn't run (expected in development)

**Solution**:
```bash
cd yyd/apps/client
npx tsx scripts/test-webhook.ts <bookingId> <paymentIntentId>
```

### How to find the booking ID?
1. Check the browser URL: `/booking-confirmation?bookingId=XXX`
2. Or check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, "bookingNumber", status FROM bookings 
   ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

### Email not sending in development?
**Expected!** Replit Mail only works in production (deployed).

The confirmation email code is ready - it will work automatically when you deploy.

---

## 🚀 **Production Setup**

### Stripe Webhooks

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret
6. Add to Replit Secrets: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

### Email Configuration
**No configuration needed!** Replit Mail works automatically in production.

### Testing in Production
1. Deploy your app
2. Make a test booking with Stripe test mode
3. Webhook fires automatically
4. Customer sees confirmation immediately
5. Email is sent via Replit Mail
